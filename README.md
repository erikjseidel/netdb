The netdb project. Requires mongodb and flask.

WARNING: Thar be dragons here:

This current version of netdb is somewhat a rough draft. Its data model has been changed on several occasions based on learnings gleaned from various stages of the SoT integration process. 

This has resulted in a somewhat messy / experimental codebase. I anticipate that there will be yet further changes to the model as other SoTs are integrated (and Peering Manager in particular). Once the data model is sufficiently 'settled', it may be worthwhile to do a thorough clean up the codebase and add appropriate unit tests aligned to the 'final' data model.

Intended for POC use only at this point.
